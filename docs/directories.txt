                      [This path needs to be identical for all PC's so that include path can be directly declared in sources]

                   c) Build locally

  - name      <- DLL's will be copied to [bin] during build
    - custom 
      dirs

- tools       - Engine Tools projects. They should produce single [bin] directory having executable and DLL's
  - name
