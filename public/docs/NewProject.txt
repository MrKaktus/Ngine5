Creating Project:
=================

In terminal run:

> Engine/public/scripts/newProject.cmd ProjectName

Where "ProjectName" is the name you want to use for your project.
This script will generate directory structure and all other files
required to easily write project on both Windows and macOS.

Project will be located in:

Engine
Projects
> "ProjectName"
  > bin
  > build
  > project
  > resources  - all intermediate resources used during development
    > fonts
    > models
    > shaders
    > textures
  > src        - whole source code of project (.c/.cpp/.mm/.h/.hpp/.inc files will be automatically picked up)

Generating IDE Project Files:
=============================

Double click on one of files:

ProjectName/project/generateProjectForVisualStudio2015.bat
ProjectName/project/generateProjectForVisualStudio2017.bat
ProjectName/project/generateProjectForXcode.command

To generate Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017 Solutions, or on macOS currently used Xcode Workspace.

How generator works:
====================

Step 1 - Initial preparation
----------------------------

On Windows:
- newProject.cmd 
  runs -> newProject.ps1
  - generates directory structure
  - copies files from:
    Engine\public\scripts\project 
    into proper locations in created directory structure
  - replaces ENGINE_PROJECT_NAME string with "ProjectName" provided by user in all files
  
On macOS:

[[[ TODO ]]]


This is one time step, performed only once on one of the two systems, but generating files,
that are compatible with both of them, and alowing second step to be performed multiple times
on both Windows and macOS.

Step 2 - CMake IDE Projects Generation
--------------------------------------

- single CMake file shared by both Windows and MacOS (customized for both Visual Studio and Xcode)
- above script is executed by:

On Windows:

- ProjectName/project/generateProjectForVisualStudio2015.bat
- ProjectName/project/generateProjectForVisualStudio2017.bat
  runs -> patchProject.ps1

On MacOS:

- ProjectName/project/generateProjectForXcode.command

  [[[ TODO ]]]

After CMake finishes generation of IDE Project files, scripts above spawns OS specific scripts that
clean up IDE Projects from any CMake references.


Step 3 - Building Project by IDE and sync with Engine
