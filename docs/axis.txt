- Coordinate Spaces are Right-Handed
- World Space:
  - Up    - Z+ (gravity -Z)
  - Look  - Y+
  - Right - X+

- Object Space (rotated left by 90 deg around Up vector):
  - Up    - Z+
  - Look  - X+
  - Right - Y- (Left +Y)

- Vectors are Columns -> Matrices are stored in Column-Major order
            max x vec
  antivec x mat

  -> vectors can be stored in continuous way in memory, pointers to vectors etc.
  -> vectors as rows could use DPPS to calculate dot product of two ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37879678/dot-product-performance-with-sse-instructions )
  -> Then pass Matrices to Shaders as set of row-vectors -> as row-vector x vector is how matrix multiply works

World Space coordinate system (Right Handed):

                  RIGHT

All rotations are clock-wise positive (when looking from center towards the arrow):

Roll left      -
Roll right     +
Pitch up       +
Pitch down     -
Turn/yaw left  +
Turn/yaw right -

Cross products:

X = Y x Z 
Y = Z x X
Z = X x Y






Example Units specification:
----------------------------

coordinate system: left handed

gravity convention: in which direction is gravity pointing? Seems like its negative y.

Euler Angles: which order of rotation (there are 64 different possibilities!). Seems like its Kardan, with z -> y -> x, all counter clockwise.

Quaternions: Is w rotating clock wise or counterclockwise around the xyz vector?

Units: SI? Seems like the unit translation is ment to be 1 meter.








Entity / Oriented:

Default orientation (RH):

Side vector is calculated with right-handed orientation rule.

  Rotation matrices relate to coordinate systems in the following way.
  Mathematical convention requires that a positive rotation angle
  generates a clockwise rotation when looking from the origin towards
  the positive end of the rotation axis.

  Applying this rule, allows for the derivation of three Cartesian
  rotation matrices. Consider a right-handed coordinate system. For each
  rotation axis, look from the origin towards the positive end of the
  selected axis. This generates the following three views:


     +----------------------------------------+
     |                                        |
     |   X-axis       Y-axis        Z-axis    |
     |                                        |

     |  |            |                    |   |
     |  |            |                    |   |
     |  |            |                    |   |

  Since a positive rotation angle generates a clockwise rotation, it is
  possible to generate a set of coordinate mappings for each rotation.
  For simplicity, a rotation of +90 will be considered:

  Starting with the X-axis:

   ( 0, 1, 0 ) -> ( 0, 0, 1 )
   ( 0, 0, 1 ) -> ( 0,-1, 0 )
   ( 0,-1, 0 ) -> ( 0, 0,-1 )
   ( 0, 0,-1 ) -> ( 0, 1, 0 )

  These can be simplified to:

    X' =  X
    Y' = -Z
    Z' =  Y

  These can then be placed into a matrix:

         | 1  0       0     |
    Rx = | 0  cos A  -sin A |
         | 0  sin A   cos A |


  Doing the same for the Y-axis:

    ( 0, 0, 1) -> ( 1,0, 0)
    ( 1, 0, 0) -> ( 0,0,-1)
    ( 0, 0,-1) -> (-1,0, 0)
    (-1, 0, 0) -> ( 0,0, 1)

  These can be simplified to:

    X' = Z
    Y' = Y
    Z' = -X

  These can then be placed into a matrix:

         |  cos A   0   sin A  |
    Ry = |  0       1   0      |
         | -sin A   0   cos A  |

  And finally for the Z-axis:

    ( 0, 1, 0 ) -> ( -1,  0, 0 )
    (-1, 0, 0 ) -> (  0, -1, 0 )
    ( 0,-1, 0 ) -> (  1,  0, 0 )
    ( 1, 0, 0 ) -> (  0,  1, 0 )

  These can be simplified to:

    X' = -Y
    Y' =  X
    Z' =  Z

  Placing these into a matrix:

         |  cos A   -sin A    0  |
    Rz = |  sin A    cos A    0  |
         |  0        0        1  |

  These are the three basic rotation matrices used by OpenGL.


So, positive rotations about GLOBAL AXES would be :

// Rotation CW around Y/up axis:
//
//       |  cos A    0        sin A    0  |
//  Ry = |  0        1        0        0  |
//       | -sin A    0        cos A    0  |
//       |  0        0        0        1  |
//

//       |  0        0        1        0  |
//       |  0        0        0        1  |

b.normalize();

float fsin = sin(radians(deg));

float ty = (a.y * fcos) - (a.z * fsin);

a.y = ty;
a.z = tz;
