3 layers of assets:
-------------------

1) Development assets
   ------------------
   Assets on initial stage of creation. They are stored in easy to modify, loseless
   file formats. For optimal work this should be:
   PSD, FBX

2) Temporary assets
   ----------------
   Assets that are propositions of final assets, or work as a placeholders for them
   during game development. Game engine is capable of using them, but its performance
   can be lower than when using release assets. Supported texture formats:
   PNG, TGA, BMP
   Supported model and scene formats:
   FBX, OBJ + MTL
   Supported audio formats:
   WAV

3) Release assets
   --------------
   Final version of assets, optimized specifically for HW on which game will be played.
   Textures are recompressed to PVRTC, ETC, DXT compressions etc. Models are optimized 
   for GPU buffers usage (also primitive restart, attribute divisor, etc.). Everything
   is stored in binary, engine proprietary formats:
   MATERIAL
   MODEL
   SCENE
   OGG (?)
